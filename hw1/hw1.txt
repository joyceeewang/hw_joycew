PROBLEM 4
The end contents of in would be [5,1,1,1,1]. When the n in funcA reaches 0, it will return 1 because the contents of in have not been touched. This then sets in[0] to 1. So when funcB is called, in[0] is always 1. FuncB swaps in[0] and in[x]. When in leaves funcB, in[0] is the integer x+1 and in[x] is 1. But when in goes back to funcA, the in[0] is reset to 1. By the last call of funcB, in = [1,1,1,1,5]. After swapping, in = [5,1,1,1,1]. The program returns 1 and ends.
